# problem 2.11
- In warfare you generally want to hit a particular target (as opposed to haveing the cannon shells land indiscriminately). However, this is not easy, since very small changes in any of the parameter can lead to large channges in the landing site of the shell.Investigate this by calculating how much the range of the cannon shell considered in this section would change if the initial speed is increased by 1 persent. Also compute the change in the range if there is a slight (10km/h) wind (this effect can be added using the methods developed in the next section ). You should find that even these relatively small changes alter the landing site by quite significant amounts.
